# **Gura** from Atlantis

![Gura](https://media.tenor.com/images/06d7e6fafac64aafd5e353e3d76949e5/tenor.gif)
A descendant of the **Lost City** of **Atlantis**, who swam to Earth while saying, "It's so boring down there **LOLOLOL!**" She bought her clothes (and her **shark** hat) in the human world and she really **loves** them. In her spare time, she enjoys talking to marine life.
